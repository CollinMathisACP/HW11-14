<h1>Animations</h1>
<p>
To create the animations between charts that we saw from Dr. B's test score visualizations, we use d3's .transition() function. This is a 
wonderful function that, when combined with an event listener (such as a button with an on-click) can be used to smoothly change from one 
data set to another. It can be modified by other functions, such as .duration(), which specifies the length (in milliseconds) of the 
transition, .delay(), which specifies a time delay before the transition takes place, and most importantly, .ease(). .ease() specifies how 
the transition should procede, with regards to acceleration. This can be quite useful for fine-tuning a visualization. When used 
effectively, these functions can provide a great deal of help for dealing with changing data sets, with relatively little hassle.
